Lumel Assessment - https://lumel-app.netlify.app/

Result: Not Selected.

Mistakes:
I didn't analyze the problem properly.
I chose useState instead of redux for state management.
I focused more on the time than the code because it was a 2-hour assessment.

I will rewrite the code for practice and ensure I don't repeat the same mistakes - Started to rewrite in my free time.
